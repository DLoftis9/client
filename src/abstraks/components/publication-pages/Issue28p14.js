              Sigourney Weaver movies straight wrapped it up to me. This past year I made history in
              spray painting live at the MFA which had never been done before. It was a huge honor
              and meant so much to me and the graffiti world on the whole. I am very proud to have

              whole life. I was always the kid in class who drew my friends around fourth grade, had
              these graff mags and wanted me to do characters like the ones in them. Years later I
              realized I got that early push so people was my thing to draw. Now the difference

              Taner Tumkaya jacks around in all trades. Starting his own production company in Los
              Angeles in 2011, Tar Films creates a range of photography and video including
              narrative, experimental, music and fashion videos, and works for various commercial
              enterprises. Deeply rooted in fine art and its many contradictions, Taner has a long
              history of working in other mediums including sculpture, animation, sound scape, and
              graphic design. As an artist, Taner stands restless and difficult to pin down as he
              eagerly explores one idea after the next. With nearly every project, a feeling of
              resistance emerges. Resistance to consensus opinions, orderly execution and non-linear
              narratives.

              Early on, Taner focused his creative sensibilities on fine art. In 1997, Taner began
              his education with a B.A in sculpture at Hecettepe University in Ankara, the capital
              of Turkey. With a year in between, he went on to get his M.F.A in Interdisciplinary
              Arts at St√§delschule, a contemporary fine arts academy in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
